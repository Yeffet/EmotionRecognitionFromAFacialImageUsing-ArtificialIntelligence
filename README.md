This project applies artificial intelligence to detect emotions from facial images. It takes image data, preprocesses it to extract facial features, then classifies each image into emotion categories (e.g., happy, sad, angry). By automating the detection of facial expressions, it aims to aid in analysis tasks across diverse fields such as psychology, marketing, and user experience.

Specific Explanations

Data Preprocessing: Reads facial images, resizes or normalizes them, and extracts features relevant to emotion classification.

Model Training: Uses a machine learning or deep learning framework (such as a neural network) to learn the underlying features of each emotional expression.

Model Evaluation: Tests the trained model against labeled data, utilizing metrics like accuracy or a confusion matrix to gauge performance.

Prediction: Applies the trained model to new images, outputting the predicted emotion label for real-time or batch analysis.
